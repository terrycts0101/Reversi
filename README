=================
Reversi Game with AI Control
-----------
Reversi is a strategy board game for two players, played on an 8¡Á8 uncheckered
board. There are sixty-four identical game pieces called disks (often spelled
"discs"), which are light on one side and dark on the other. Players take turns
placing disks on the board with their assigned color facing up. During a play,
any disks of the opponent's color that are in a straight line and bounded by
the disk just placed and another disk of the current player's color are turned
over to the current player's color. More details about the game rules can be
found in [1].

This program is a graphical implementation of the reversi game. It builds
the user-interface using the Tkinter module in Python. The program can also
support other functions including AI control, loading from previous game and
music play.

2. When the introduction window is launched, make a selection based on the
   instruction and press the "play" button.
3. When the game window is launched, press <left>, <right>, <up> or <down> to
   move the piece and press <space> to place the piece.
4. During the game, you can press <Esc> to exit the game and save the current
   condition.
5. The program will automatically terminate after several seconds when the
   end-of-game condition is met. When the game ends, you can view the final
   result at Model/result.log.
